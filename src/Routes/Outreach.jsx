As part of this effort, we plan on establishing an outreach committee that will assist in planning and hosting outreach events through partnering with a local high school to peak studentsâ€™ interest in the exciting field of ECE. Alongside our outreach committee, we plan to collaborate with diversity and honor engineering organizations such as SWE and HKN, respectively, to expose K-12 students to careers in STEM. We will be targeting middle school and high school girls with SWE and hosting educational workshops for local high schools with HKN."/>
